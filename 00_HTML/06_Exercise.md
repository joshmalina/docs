## Requirements

* All pages should have the logo ('html-exercise-butteryfly-logo.jpg')

* Short blurb about the bakery
* Address
* Hours
	
A contact page:

A menu page:

* Includes the image `html-exercise-coffee-and-snack.jpg` at the top
* Convert some of `html-exercise-menu.pdf` into a [HTML table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) (just enough for proof of concept)
