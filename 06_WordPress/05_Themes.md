## Finding themes

* The active theme is shown at the top of the **Appearance** page in wp-admin
* Find new themes under Appearance > Add New
* Filter themes by color, column, width, and features
* To learn more about a theme, visit its page in the WordPress Themes Directory

### Free themes
* Budget friendly, limited selection
* Stick to the WordPress themes directory b/c they're vouced for and less likely to have malware

### Premium themes
* Cost $$, typically between $10 and $100 
* Often come with better customization options and online support
* Some good marketplaces:
	* [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/themes/wordpress)
	* [The Best Designs](http://www.thebestdesigns.com/design/themes/)
	
### Custom themes








## What to look for 

* Make sure it matches your goal:
	* Ex: Selling TShirts? Look for a e-commerce styled theme
	* Ex: Selling guided tours? Look for a mobile friendly theme
* Customization
	* Look at the theme specs - what do they let you control?
* Structure
	* Valid, up-to-date HTML/CSS 
	* Search Engine Optimized 
* Good documentation and support 
* Lots of downloads and positive reviews is a good sign
* Up to date - avoid themes like this: <http://wordpress.org/themes/abel-one>




## Install our theme

Chosen theme: <http://wordpress.org/themes/mog>

* There are two ways to install themes.
* With Theme Installer, just click the Install button. So easy!
* Otherwise, to manually install a theme, we can download it to our computer, then upload it (via FTP) directly into wp-content > Themes.
* You can activate a different theme by clicking the Activate link next to any theme.

## Customize Theme

* Upload a header ala *Appearance :: Header* <http://thewc.co/images/tasks/wordpress-graphics-by-liz.png>
* Uncheck *Show header text with your image.*
* Set background color to white ala *Appearance :: Background*


## Reading Settings
Right now when you land on the site it shows recent blog posts, which doesn't match the goal of our project. 

In *Settings :: Reading* change the Front page display to *A static page*

Make the Front page set to *Home*

And the Posts page set to *Blog*

## What's next?
We've maxed out the theme's customziations. If you wanted to customize further, you'd have to hit the code.

You can see the code via *Appearance :: Editor* but it's not suggested you make edits here because if you ever needed to update your theme you'd lose all your work.

Instead, you'd want to create a Child Theme, which is beyond the scope of this course. 

You can read more about that here: <http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes>
