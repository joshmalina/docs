Tack on `/wp-admin` to your domain, ex: `http://username.wcc-hosting.com/wp-admin`

WP-Admin gives you access to the following things:

1. What's happening
2. Creating new content
3. Configure and customize

Organize the dashboard via **Screen Options**

Author new content via **Posts**, **Pages** and **Media**

**Settings**: Basic site configurations


## Appearance
This is where you customize your site

* Themes
* Widgets 
* Menus
* Header
* Background
* Editor


## Posts and Pages

### Posts = Blog entries
* Individual blog-like entries on your WordPress site. 
* By default, all posts are listed on your site's homepage, in reverse chronological order. 
* Posts are typically something you'll create regularly.

### Pages = Pages on your site
* Pages on your site. Ex: About Page, Portfolio Page, Contact page. 
* Unlike posts which you might be creating on a regular basis, pages are pretty static.

### Other differences 
* Posts are included in the RSS feed WordPress generates for your site.
* Pages can be nested. Example: Within a page called Portfolio, you may nest a page for Illustration, Photography, Video, etc. (It's like WordPress inception.)
* You can have a page that displays posts. For example, you might want to create a page called Top 5 that shows your top 5 blog posts of all time.
