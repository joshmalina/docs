* If your server prevents automatic installation

Procedure:

* Find the plugin you want (whether it be on the [WordPress.org Plugins Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/), a premium plugin store like [CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/), or on a plugin's website like the [Yoast SEO plugin](http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/)) and download.
* Unzip the plugin file.
* FTP into your server and move the unzipped nextgen-gallery folder into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.


## Set up

Remember to activate your plugin before getting started!
