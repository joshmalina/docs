## Goal
Let's pull all this information together into a working program. Your goal is to create an app that runs a raffle, picking random winners each time the browser is refreshed.

* You have the same 4, hard-coded contestants every time.
* Every time the browser refreshes, the program will determine whether each contestant is either a loser or winner.
* It's okay to have more than one winner or loser at a time.

## Bonus Challenges
If you're looking for an extra challenge, you can try adding these features to your app:

* If no winner was selected, print a message that says "<em>No winners this round :(</em>"
* If more than one winner is selected, print a message that says "<em>It's a tie!</em>"
* What other features can you think to add?
