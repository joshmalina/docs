## References
The previous documents serve as an overview of some of the most common programming paradigms you'll use in PHP. The purpose of these docs is not to be a complete reference of PHP, but instead a quick-start version with enough information to get you digging in.

For a complete reference, keep the php.net manual handy, specifically the [language reference section](http://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php).
