## Intro
### Some quick vocabulary:
* The default branch name in Git is master.
* Your remote repository (what's on Github.com) is referred to as origin. 

### The basics of Branching:
Branching in Git is the process of sending code Commits to different *branches* of your repository.

The moment you create a branch and commit some changes to it, you create a snapshot of your codebase at that time. 

Every new commit changes that snapshot.

This means that as we switch between different branches on our local computers, your codebase will actually change based on what branch you're on. It's like switching between different snapshots.

## Basic usage
When beginning to code a new feature on a project, ideally you should do so via a Git branch. This will allow you to commit your changes to a working branch rather than the master branch, so your changes can be reviewed by other developers without holding up the master branch from being deployed.

There are two different "starting points" from which you might want to create a branch:

* You know you're about to work on a new feature, so you start off with a new branch.
* You've already made some changes to some files on the new features, and now you want to put them in a new branch.

Let's assume we're starting with #1. Imagine you're working on a new promotional feature involving prize giveaways. We'll call this feature "prizes", and we want to create a new branch to do the work for this feature.

First, let's run this command to see what branches already exist on your local repository:

	git branch

In my current repo I see this (foobar was a test branch created earlier):

	  foobar
	* master

That means I have two branches, "master" and "foobar". The asterisk indicates I'm currently "in" the master branch.

To create my new "prizes" branch, I run this command:

	git branch prizes

Now let's see those branches again:

	git branch

	  foobar
	* master
	  prizes

With our new "prizes" branch created, we need to switch to it ala the `checkout` command

	git checkout prizes
	
	Switched to branch 'prizes'
	
	git branch

	  foobar
	  master
	* prizes

Cool. This means any commits I make will be made to the "prizes" branch.

So let's do our work on prizes. We'll make a simple change to one of our files called `c_index.php`

If we run git status, we see this:

	$ git status
	# On branch prizes
	# Changes not staged for commit:
	#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	#
	#	modified:   ../controllers/c_index.php
	#
	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Let's say that's all I needed to do for that feature, and now I want to commit it to Github so the developer I'm collaborating with can see my work. 

First, I need to stage my changes, then I need to commit them

	$ git add ../controllers/c_index.php
	$ git commit -m "New prize feature"
	[prizes 7b5875b] New prize feature
	 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)

Now let's push this new branch. The following command says push to "origin" (remember, that's our repo on Github) our "prizes" branch. 

	$ git push origin prizes
	Counting objects: 9, done.
	Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
	Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
	Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 504 bytes, done.
	Total 5 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0)
	To git@github.com:susanBuck/jarapps.git
	 * [new branch]      prizes -> prizes
	

In Github, your should see this new branch:

If you tell Github to switch to prizes, and then go to "Commits" you'll see your commit we just made.
If you switch it back to master and then go to "Commits" you'll see it's not there. This is good.


At this point, your collaborator may want to look at your work on their local environment. To do that, they would run this command:

	git pull origin prizes 

Now they too will have that branch on their local system and they can "checkout" into that branch to see your code.
You can both "pass" back and forth code changes this way, without ever messing with the master branch.


## Merging your branch
When a feature is done and ready to be integrated into the master branch, you need to first switch to the master branch

	git checkout master

This is key: *Make sure you're in the branch you want to merge into.*

Then run git merge followed by the name of the branch you wish to merge

	$ git merge prizes
	Updating 18f80dd..97be048
	Fast-forward
	 mydomain.com/controllers/c_index.php |    7 +++++++
	 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+)

Now that we've merged, we'll need to do a "git push" because our master branch now has a bunch of commits waiting from the prizes branch we just merged on.

## Keeping your branch updated

When working on a branch you can / should try and keep it up to date with the master branch to avoid conflicts down the road.

	git checkout prizes
	git pull origin master

Once you do this, it will initiate a new commit of all the changes. Make sure you push this commit to your branch, not the master branch. When using a GUI it can be easy to make this mistake...because you just did a pull from master to branch...If you were to hit push it'd go branch to master when you really want branch to branch.


<!--
# Branch / Merge Conflicts

If the files you've been editing on your branch haven't been changed on the master branch, your merge will go smoothly. If there have been changes, though, you'll get a merge conflict.

Here I created a branch "foobar" where I committed a change to c_index.php. Then I went to the master branch, made a change to c_index.php and then tried to merge foobar:

	$ git merge foobar
	error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
		mydomain.com/controllers/c_index.php
	Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
	Aborting

Let's look at few ways of addressing this

One, You can commit the conflicted file...This is the easiest answer, but isn't always ideal because you might not be ready to commit. 

Two, You can stash your changes then merge

	git stash 

Then when you merge, it will auto-merge the differences, so you'll have to open c_index.php and resolve the changes.

	git merge foobar

Or three, the method that is pretty inelegant but sometimes it hurts my head the least: just make a copy of the conflicted file to somewhere safe (i.e. your desktop)...Then "revert" any changes to that file. It will then allow you to do the merge. 

After the merge you want to look what the actual changes were and integrate your changes back in.

Deleting branches
If you're done with your branch, its good to clean things up (you can always branch again if you need to re-work your feature). The following will delete your branch on your local environment:

	git brancÂ­h -d prizes

And then this will remove it from Github:

	git push origin --delete prizes

## Branching with GUIs
A lot of the above commands can also be accomplished via the Git GUI's. For example, in Gitbox you can choose your local branch on the top left drop down and your origin branch from the top right drop down.
