Welcome to Version Control with Git!

The following documents are intended to get you rolling with Git by understanding the following compoenents:

* What is Git/Version Control and why we use it.
* Setting up a local development environment.
* Working with repositories and Github.com.
* Deploying work to your live servers.
* Briefly covered: Branching / Stashing.

Some Git-essentials *not* covered here:

* Checking out changes
* Merging
* Forking
* Reverting commits
* Advanced collaboration

The goal of these documents is not to be a comprehensive manual for working with Git; instead, these documents serve to get your feet wet with a working understanding of Git.

It is expected that after you work your way through the steps in these documents, you will move on to [Scott Chacon's Pro Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book) which is an excellent go-to resource for becoming a Git power user.

Before you dig into any of this, though, it's suggested you view the [Chacon's Git Videos](http://git-scm.com/videos) (about 25 min total). They provide a great overview of Git, which will help make things click quicker as you dig in.
