So far, we've been operating Git via Command Line. This is an important skill to have because it allows you to interact with Git without limits.

Once you understand git commands, though, there are some apps designed to work with Git that can make your daily-life-git-interactions more pleasant if you feel more comfortable using GUI (Graphical User Interface) Apps.


There are many different kinds of Git Apps ([some examples](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)), but we'll be working with the one created by Github.com.


## Setup
1. Download the Gitub app:  
[Mac Version](http://mac.github.com/)

4. Then, the app will search for any existing repositories on your computer. It should find your hello-world project, so check that off.

5. Click on the hello-world repository in the Github App to see everything you can do.
