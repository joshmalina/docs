## Recap
* Three methods of applying styles + the pros and cons of each
* Three methods of selecting elements (what are they and what is their syntax)




## Quirky syntax
Most values for a style declaration are pretty simple:

	color:red;

But some are more complex:

	background-image:url('http://placekitten.com/200/200');

Some work together to create a specific effect:

	background-image:url('http://placekitten.com/200/200');
	background-repeat:no-repeat;
	background-position:center;

Some values can include multiple bits of information:

	border:3px solid green;

All of these quirky little rules are outlined in the reference for each style you're working with, so don't worry about memorizing every little detail.




## Links
HTML Selectors might also have what are called CSS pseudo-classes. Links are a good example of this as they use the following pseudo-classes for their four different states: link, visited, hover, active.

This is how you can add pseudo-classes to style the `<a>` selector:

	a:link {
		color:#000000;
	 	text-decoration:none;
	}    
	a:visited {
		color:#00FF00;
	}
	a:hover {
		color:#FF00FF;
	}
	a:active {
		color:#0000FF;
	}

Tip about styling your link states: if you don't style them in the order shown above, you may get some unexpected results.

You can remember the order with this handy acronym: **LoVe HAte (Link, Visited, Hover, Active)**.




## Colors
CSS has a selection of named colors you can use:

	color:red;
	color:blue;
	color:yellow;
	
So on...(full list here: <http://www.147colors.com/grid/>)

But if you want full control of your color, using variations of shades, you'll need to find its hexadecimal value which is a 6 character code specifying that color.

<http://colorpicker.com> is a really simple tool that lets you figure out the hex value for the color you want.

	color:#800E2A;
	
	
	
	
## Fonts
Web safe fonts examples: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Georgia, etc. ([full list](http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html))

Font stacks

	<style>
		  .profits {
			  font-family: Garamond, Georgia, Serif;
		 }
	</style>





## Web Inspectors
* How to open
* Selecting via the elements window vs. with the magnify glass
* Crossed out styles are ones that have been overwritten
* Computed styles
* None of the changes are permanent





## Exercise
Recreate the following page:

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/css-basics-exercise.png' style='border:1px solid black'>

Use an external style sheet.

Approach the design from the outside in&mdash; specifically by beginning with the outer box and then moving in from there. You don't want to get hung up on little details like the style of your bullet points before you get the bigger pieces together.

You don't have match the exact width, height, font sizes or shades of color; just try to get as close as you can.

Think about using the best tag and selector for the job. For example, if you have a large heading, an  h1 tag would be more spot-on than a generic div tag.

This exercise is designed to get you digging through the [CSS reference list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference); you'll want to look into some properties we haven't covered yet such as margin, padding and styling links.
