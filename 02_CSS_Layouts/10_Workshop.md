## Option 0: Freestyle

For this option you can choose any layout style you wish and any content you wish. Maybe you've had a rough idea for a site rolling around in your head and you want to lay out an initial scaffold for it&mdash; Now's your chance.

## Option 1: Fixed width
You know it, you love it&mdash; the fixed width layout. The whole shebang, as well as each column, should have widths that don't change no matter the size of the browser. This one differs slightly from the last fixed practice in that it has three columns.

## Option 2: Semi-fluid
This is a semi-fluid layout. The yellow left sidebar should stay a fixed width, but everything else should stretch and shrink with the browser window. As the window gets smaller, the main text should wrap around the two images on the left. <strong>Bonus hint:</strong> While this might look, at first glance, like a 3-column layout, it's actually 2. Think about where in the HTML to put the kitties on the right to keep them moving with the main body text.

## Option 3: Fluid

This is a fluid layout. All three columns stretch and shrink with the page, while maintaining their proportional relationship to each other. The nav and the header should stay centered as they get wider and narrower.
