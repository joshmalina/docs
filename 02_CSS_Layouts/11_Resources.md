This little tool will generate layouts for you based on the settings you give it; I know what you're thinking: If there's a tool for this, why'd we spend the last two weeks learning about layouts?! Trust us&mdash; even though there are tools like this, you'll want to know the inner workings of the code in order to customize and fully control your layouts.

Frameworks are libraries of pre-written code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) that can help give your website an appealing style from the get-go. Think templates, but even more powerful and packed with more features. One benefit of digging into a framework like Bootstrap, is there's lots of built in code that can help with responsive techniques.
