**Latest Release: Wednesday Oct 2, 2013**

Occasionally, updates to the Framework core may be released throughout the semester. There will be an announcement if updates are required.

Because you cloned this framework from Github, updates are easy: you just need to do a git pull from the `core/` directory on both your local *and* live server.

Local Mac Example:

	cd /Users/your-username/Sites/core/
	git pull origin master


Local Windows example:

	cd c:\wamp\www\core
	git pull origin master
	
Live Example:
	
	cd /home/your-username/public_html
	git pull origin master

Updates will only impact what's in `core/`; it will not impact any of your existing apps or environment.php.
