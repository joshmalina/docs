### Women in tech++

[The WCC's](http://thewc.co) approach:

1. Environments and visibility
2. Resources and education
3. **Outreach: young girls**

<!--
More women in tech starts with more girls in tech

If you want to be respected in tech as a Woman, don't call yourself a girl. See, if we start referring to the women in tech as women, we'll have a lot more women when we get rid of the girls. And when I say women, I mean people who have menstruated and payed taxes. If you do both, you're a woman. It's pretty simple. Calling yourself a girl may be cute and fun, but it's hurtful to making a tech a better, more comfortable place for women.
