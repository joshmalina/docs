			These eggs are some of the most beautiful and rarest dinosaur eggs in the world. The eggs are from long neck dinosaurs, which contrary to popular belief, laid their eggs in nests. Some eggs of this type have been identified as Saltasaurus, others belong to Argentinosaurus. All these specimens come from Uruguay and belong to Argentinosaurus. The egg shell from this site is a translucent tan colour as contrasted to the white shell colour found in most eggs of similar type found in Argentina sites.
