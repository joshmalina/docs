<pre style="font-size:16px;">Three Hours of Sitting


On theatrical black boards
    there lay camel humps that brew tea
      and pour them out in triangles
        For the courteous figures in saliva.
                A pregnant white beaver’s tail
            drops limp above the pompous queen’s
         upper lip where it ensnares morsels
of lobster tail chips grown in boots
and she is charged guilty of cheating her diet.
            Bamboo blades of ice skates
             Are hammered between the toes of eyes
             While he sits upon three swaying scaffolds
                          Steaming beans for high tea.
   While our tea still sits in our stomachs
We hit the ground sprinting
   Catapulting bodies off their backs
      And the deafening tunnel of roaring
          Infiltrates each ear with a small mumbled prayer.
