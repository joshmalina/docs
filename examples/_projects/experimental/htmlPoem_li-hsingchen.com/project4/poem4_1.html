<body style="background-color:white;">
<pre style="font-size:14px;">
He imitates my eyes
With an equally potent scorn.
When my eyes enlarge themselves,
His green eyes pop open.
When my eyes squint,
His eyes follow suit.
When one of my eyes lay open,
And the other closed,
His face repeats mine.
And now, a new plan.
My palms itch for his soft fur,
My lips starve for his purrs,
My nose awaits the stench of his sweaty sleep.
