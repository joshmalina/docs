<body style="background-color:white;">
<pre style="font-size:14px;">
A thunderbolt of feline
hurtles into my dozing afternoon
And shreds me from my rest
To display his bratty self-centeredness.
He is agitated,
Irritated -
Won’t let me touch him,
Won’t let me in.
So now I stand aggravated
For I only want his paws
to warm up where he let the air in.
I cease to comfort him
And stare at him with contempt.
