<body style="background-color:white;">
<pre style="font-size:14px;">
So I invent a visage of slumber
That he too can emulate
In hopes that he would sleep at last.
I breath like a sleeping character,
He breaths like a sleeping lion,
And I smack my lips as if dreaming,
and he taps his pink tongue to the same rhythm.
After mechanic minutes and still bodies,
I crack the lid of my eye open
To peek at my progression
Yet the sound of my
thick eyelashes, scraping
against one another, screeching
the concentrated silence, stirs
his eyes to open on cue.
His pupils dart at me
spelling out the backfired plan
that to my disgust
he too planned to use upon me.
